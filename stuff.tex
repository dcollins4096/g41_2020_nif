Current theoretical and
numerical evidence indicate that, for fully developed supersonic turbulence, the density variance is related to the velocity
variance as
\begin{align}
\sigma_\rho^2 = b (\sigma_v/c_s)^2.\label{eqn_sigma}
\end{align}
The environment of the clouds birth determine the velocity variance, $\sigma_v$,
which then determines the density variance, $\sigma_\rho$.  The parameter $b$
is of order unity.  

A combined with the other forces in the
gas, then determines the fraction of the cloud that is
dense enough to collapse.  Equation \ref{eqn_sigma} can be reasoned by
order-of-magnitude arguments, and seems to stand up to simulations.  However, to
date this has not been experimentally verified.
